# Thinkpad P14s Gen 2 AMD Easy Effects preset

This [Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) preset tries to improve the sound of the built-in speakers.

It was created by following the excellent guide [_Enhancing your internal notebook speakers without using an Equalizer_](https://wwmm.github.io/easyeffects/guide_1.html) by Markus Schmidt. It's also included in the Easy Effects help. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/blob/v7.1.0/help/C/guide_1.page). I highly recommend it!

With some bass-heavy music this preset can lead to distortions. You'll have to reduce the _Amount_ of the _Bass Enhancer_ effect to avoid that.

The preset approprate for Easy Effects prior to version 7.0 can be found in the `easyeffects6` branch.
